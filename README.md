Overview:

This repository contains all models, experiments, and results from the paper _Skin Cancer Detection Through Various Classification Models_. All models and experiments are implemented using Keras and Tensorflow. Below is the organization structure:

- Skin_Lesion_Advanced_Models_Olivia_Rogers/ contains the preprocessing of the Kaggle HAM10000 Skin Cancer MNIST dataset, as well as the model initialization, testing, training, and analysis of the following models:
  - KNN
  - Decision Tree
  - SVC
  - Random Forest
  - MLP
- Skin_Lesion_Project_Olivia_Rogers/ contains the preprocessing of the Kaggle HAM10000 Skin Cancer MNIST dataset, as well as the model initialization, testing, training, and analysis of the advanced model, ResNet50.
